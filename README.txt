A work in progress as I learn more HTML/CSS and web design. This is my personal website hosted using github pages.


Currently using the fullPage j-Query based plugin developed by Alvaro Trigo, https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/.

- DONE add icons to skills
- DONE mobile friendly?
- DONE single page scroll bar
